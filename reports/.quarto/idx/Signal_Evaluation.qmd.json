Rolling IC Diagnostics\n\nWe compute **rolling window statistics** (e.g., 8 quarters) to assess local IC behavior over time:\n\n- `rolling_mean_ic`\n- `rolling_ic_std`\n- `rolling_ic_sharpe`\n- `rolling_t_stat`\n\nThese help detect regime sensitivity or performance decay.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nðŸ“Š **Visualization**:  \nRolling Spearman IC (mean) across time and signals for forward return horizon 1.  \nEach cell shows the average IC of a signal over a rolling window, highlighting periods of signal strength or weakness.  \nRedder regions indicate stronger positive association with future returns; blue indicates weak or negative association.\n\n![Rolling mean IC Figure](figures/rolling_heatmap_mean_ic_fr1.svg){width=95%}\n:::\n\n---\n\n# 3. Regime Stability: Non-Overlapping Metrics\n\nTo quantify regime-level consistency, we compute **non-overlapping window metrics**:\n\n- `pct_pos_windows`: Fraction of windows with positive IC\n- `sign_flips`: Number of sign changes in mean IC across windows\n\nThis avoids the autocorrelation bias of overlapping windows.\n\n---\n\n# 4. Full-Period Stability Score\n\nWe compute a **cross-sectional stability score** for each signal using a fixed set of z-scored components:\n\n$$\n\\text{Stability Score} = z(\\text{IC Sharpe}) + z(\\text{t-stat}) + z(\\%\\text{pos}) - z(\\text{sign flips}) - z(\\text{IC std})\n$$\n\nIf any component has negligible variance across signals, its contribution is set to zero to preserve comparability across horizons.  \nThis approach balances signal strength and directional consistency while avoiding instability from uninformative metrics.\n\n---\n\n# 5. Rolling Stability Score\n\nWe also assess **volatility of performance over time** via standard deviation of the rolling statistics:\n\n- `std(rolling_mean_ic)`\n- `std(rolling_ic_sharpe)`\n- `std(rolling_t_stat)`\n\nThese are combined into a **rolling stability score** (z-score based, negatively weighted).\n\n---\n\n# 6. Final Composite Score\n\nTo account for both static and dynamic characteristics of signal behavior, we then compute a **final composite score** by blending the cross-sectional stability score with a rolling stability component:\n\n$$\n\\text{Final Score} = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{Stability Score} + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot \\text{Rolling Stability Score}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha = 0.65$ by default. The rolling stability score is computed per horizon by aggregating the standard deviations of time-varying signal performance metrics (e.g., IC mean, IC Sharpe, t-stat) and applying a z-scored penalty. This ensures that signals are rewarded not only for being stable across the full sample, but also for being locally stable within rolling windows.\n\nAll signals are then ranked by their final scores to support selection and filtering.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nðŸ“Š **Visualization**:  \nFinal Composite Signal Scores Across Forward Return Horizons  \nEach cell shows the composite score of a signal at a given horizon, combining both cross-sectional and rolling stability components.  \nHigher values indicate signals that are more consistently predictive and robust across time.  \nSignals are ordered by their average score across all horizons.\n\n![Composite Score Heatmap](figures/composite_score_heatmap.svg){width=80%}\n:::\n\n---\n\n# 7.
