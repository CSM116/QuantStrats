    "text": "1 Objective\nThis report outlines a systematic framework to evaluate and select fundamental equity signals with forward-looking return predictive power over short- to mid-term horizons (e.g., 20â€“60 trading days).\nThe goal is to: - Identify signals that are both predictive and stable - Combine cross-sectional and time-series diagnostics into a unified, interpretable composite score - Rank signals across multiple horizons for use in systematic equity strategies\n\n\n2 Data & Preprocessing\nWe use quarterly Compustat fundamentals, linked to daily CRSP price and return data. Preprocessing includes: - Linking gvkey and permno via ccmxpf_linktable - Forward-filling metrics by report date (rdq) - Filtering to mid-cap stocks (interquartile range of market cap) - Calculating forward returns (fr1, fr2, fr3, fr4) aligned to earnings dates\n\n\n\n3 1. Forward-Looking IC Computation\nFor each signal and return horizon, we compute the Information Coefficient (IC) as the Spearman rank correlation between the signal value and forward return.\nComputed per signal and horizon: - mean_ic: Average IC across all months - std_ic: Standard deviation of IC - ic_sharpe: Ratio of mean_ic / std_ic - t_stat: IC t-statistic (adjusted for sample size)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nðŸ“ˆ Visualization:\nTime-series of Spearman Information Coefficient (IC) for each signal at forward return horizon 1.\nThis line plot highlights the evolving predictive power of each metric across time.\nSustained values above the zero line suggest stable and directional relationships with future returns, while fluctuations indicate changing signal relevance.\n\n\n\nIC Series Figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 2. Rolling IC Diagnostics\nWe compute rolling window statistics (e.g., 8 quarters) to assess local IC behavior over time:\n\nrolling_mean_ic\nrolling_ic_std\nrolling_ic_sharpe\nrolling_t_stat\n\nThese help detect regime sensitivity or performance decay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nðŸ“Š Visualization:\nRolling Spearman IC (mean) across time and signals for forward return horizon 1.\nEach cell shows the average IC of a signal over a rolling window, highlighting periods of signal strength or weakness.\nRedder regions indicate stronger positive association with future returns; blue indicates weak or negative association.\n\n\n\nRolling mean IC Figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 3. Regime Stability: Non-Overlapping Metrics\nTo quantify regime-level consistency, we compute non-overlapping window metrics:\n\npct_pos_windows: Fraction of windows with positive IC\nsign_flips: Number of sign changes in mean IC across windows\n\nThis avoids the autocorrelation bias of overlapping windows.\n\n\n\n6 4. Full-Period Stability Score\nWe compute a cross-sectional stability score for each signal using a fixed set of z-scored components:\n\\[\n\\text{Stability Score} = z(\\text{IC Sharpe}) + z(\\text{t-stat}) + z(\\%\\text{pos}) - z(\\text{sign flips}) - z(\\text{IC std})\n\\]\nIf any component has negligible variance across signals, its contribution is set to zero to preserve comparability across horizons.\nThis approach balances signal strength and directional consistency while avoiding instability from uninformative metrics.\n\n\n\n7 5. Rolling Stability Score\nWe also assess volatility of performance over time via standard deviation of the rolling statistics:\n\nstd(rolling_mean_ic)\nstd(rolling_ic_sharpe)\nstd(rolling_t_stat)\n\nThese are combined into a rolling stability score (z-score based, negatively weighted).\n\n\n\n8 6. Final Composite Score\nTo account for both static and dynamic characteristics of signal behavior, we then compute a final composite score by blending the cross-sectional stability score with a rolling stability component:\n\\[\n\\text{Final Score} = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{Stability Score} + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot \\text{Rolling Stability Score}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha = 0.65\\) by default. The rolling stability score is computed per horizon by aggregating the standard deviations of time-varying signal performance metrics (e.g., IC mean, IC Sharpe, t-stat) and applying a z-scored penalty. This ensures that signals are rewarded not only for being stable across the full sample, but also for being locally stable within rolling windows.\nAll signals are then ranked by their final scores to support selection and filtering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nðŸ“Š Visualization:\nFinal Composite Signal Scores Across Forward Return Horizons\nEach cell shows the composite score of a signal at a given horizon, combining both cross-sectional and rolling stability components.\nHigher values indicate signals that are more consistently predictive and robust across time.\nSignals are ordered by their average score across all horizons.\n\n\n\nComposite Score Heatmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 7. Signal Ranking & Selection\nSignals are ranked by their average final score across horizons, with optional filtering rules:\n\n\n\nMetric\nThreshold\n\n\n\n\nIC Sharpe\nâ‰¥ 0.4\n\n\nIC t-stat\nâ‰¥ 2.0\n\n\n% Positive Windows\nâ‰¥ 60%\n\n\nSign Flips\nâ‰¤ 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nðŸ“‹ Suggested Output:\nTable of top 3 signals across all horizons\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Conclusion\nThis framework enables robust selection of alpha signals by integrating both predictive power and stability diagnostics. It is designed to: - Be transparent and interpretable - Minimize overfitting by penalizing unstable signals - Align with institutional standards for factor research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nðŸ”„ Possible Extensions: - Export enriched summary_stats to CSV - Add out-of-sample validation (e.g., walk-forward IC testing) - Integrate portfolio simulation or risk-adjusted return metrics"
